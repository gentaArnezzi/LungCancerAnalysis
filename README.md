# Lung Cancer Data Analysis

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of lung cancer patients using the dataset `lung_cancer_data.csv`. The analysis aims to identify key factors influencing lung cancer survival, assess their statistical significance, and present findings through visualizations and interpretative insights.

## Dataset Information

## Reason for Choosing the Problem

Lung cancer is one of the most common and deadly forms of cancer worldwide, with high incidence and mortality rates. Understanding the factors that influence lung cancer outcomes, such as tumor size, stage, and treatment effectiveness, is crucial for improving patient prognosis and survival rates. This analysis can provide valuable insights for medical professionals, researchers, and policymakers to develop better diagnostic, preventive, and treatment strategies for lung cancer.

## Title Explanation

The title "Lung Cancer Data Analysis: Insights into Tumor Characteristics, Treatment Outcomes, and Survival" reflects the comprehensive nature of the report. It highlights the key aspects of the analysis, including tumor characteristics, treatment outcomes, and survival rates.

## Objectives

- Identify key factors influencing lung cancer survival.
- Assess the statistical significance of these factors.
- Provide visualizations and interpretative insights.

## Methods

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the distribution and relationships between variables.
2. **Kaplan-Meier Survival Curves**: Estimating the survival function over time.
3. **Cox Proportional Hazards Model**: Assessing the impact of various factors on the risk of death.

## Descriptive Statistics

- Average age of patients: 65 years
- Gender distribution: 60% male
- Smoking history: 70% of patients
- Median tumor size: 25 mm
- Most patients diagnosed at stage III
- Median survival time: 18 months

## Key Findings

1. **Cancer Stages**: Larger tumors are associated with advanced cancer stages.
2. **Tumor Size**: Larger tumor sizes slightly reduce the risk of death (HR: 0.99, CI: 0.97-1, PValue: 0.03).
3. **Ethnicity**: Some ethnic groups show a lower risk of death compared to the reference group (HR: 0.98, CI: 0.97-1, PValue: 0.017).
4. **Treatments**: Different treatments show significant differences in survival probabilities, indicating the effectiveness of certain modalities over others.

## Conclusion

This analysis provides valuable insights into lung cancer, addressing various factors that influence its prognosis and outcomes. By aligning with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3, this work supports global efforts to reduce the burden of non-communicable diseases and promote health and well-being.

## Future Research Implications

The findings suggest avenues for future research, including exploring genetic markers, environmental exposures, and longitudinal studies to understand disease progression.
